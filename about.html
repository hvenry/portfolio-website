        Hello! My name is Henry, and welcome to my portfolio website! I am an undergraduate student
        at Queen's University studying computing and specializing in cognitive science. I am a
        passionate student and even more passionate about machine learning, software development,
        web design, game design, photo/video editing... basically anything that can be done on a
        computer. Apart from computers, I enjoy cooking dinners, critiquing fashion and music,
        and playing competitive hockey whenever I get the chance. Alongside with my passions and
        hobbies, I am always looking to connect with new people, whether you share the same passion
        for computers as me or not, I won't judge! So please feel free to reach out. Take care!
        </p>
